Her mind is Tiffany-twisted
She got the Mercedes-Benz, uh
She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys
That she calls friends
How they dance in the courtyard
Sweet summer sweat
Some dance to remember
Some dance to forget
So I called up the Captain
"Please bring me my wine"
He said, "We haven't had that spirit here
Since 1969"
And still, those voices are calling
From far away
Wake you up in the middle of the night
Just to hear them say.
